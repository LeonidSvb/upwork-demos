Summary
Title: AI/Automation Development Team for HighLevel-Based Real Estate System (AI + Nationwide Scale)

Description:
I'm an experienced real estate entrepreneur with nationwide reach, building a system that is already live and running with HighLevel CRM and AI Agents.

This is not a project from scratch. We already have a functioning foundation, and now we need an experienced development team to contribute, enhance, and scale the platform to achieve its vision: becoming the market leader in Artificial Intelligence in Real Estate (AI in RE).

About the System

This AI-powered platform is designed to:

🔎 Search, analyze, and connect creative real estate deals nationwide.

🏠 Detect off-market properties across the U.S.

🎯 Filter opportunities by exact buy box criteria.

⚡ Deliver a scalable, fast pipeline from lead to closing.

💰 Analyze deal viability with creative finance terms.

🤝 Connect investors and realtors instantly, ready to transact.

📈 Provide access to exclusive off-market opportunities.

📞 Automate calls, texts, and deal analysis at scale.

🐕 Leverage a network of trained Bird Dogs in every state.

🌐 Tap into a national investor network to close deals faster.

Scope of Work

Enhance and expand AI conversational agents to feel natural and negotiation-ready.

Strengthen and scale automations inside HighLevel CRM.

Build APIs and dashboards for national deal flow.

Optimize and stabilize the system after recent upgrades.

(Optional) Add predictive analytics for discovering high-potential deals.

Requirements (must-have):

Development team (not just a solo freelancer).

Expertise in AI/ML engineering (LLMs, conversational AI).

Proven HighLevel CRM automation experience.

Full-stack development (API integrations + dashboards).

Clean, documented, scalable code.

Bilingual (English/Spanish) highly valued.

Experience with real estate systems strongly preferred.

Why Join Us:

Contribute to a system that is already operational and scaling, not a test project.

Work directly with a recognized authority in creative real estate investment.

Be part of a nationwide rollout with real traction and a powerful network.

Long-term collaboration with compensation + potential equity/revenue share.

If your team has the ambition and skills to contribute to a high-impact AI real estate platform, share your portfolio, and let's connect.
