Hi,

I've built a fully functional real estate website demo for you: https://leonidsvb.github.io/upwork-demos/demo/real-estate-website-demo.html

This demonstrates exactly what you need:
✓ Property listings with filter system (type, price, acreage, status)
✓ Advanced search functionality
✓ Contact form with inquiry system
✓ Mobile-responsive design
✓ SEO-optimized structure
✓ Fast-loading, clean code

What's included in your $400 package:
- Complete website setup from template
- Custom property listing system
- Search & filter functionality
- Contact forms with validation
- Mobile optimization
- Basic SEO setup
- 2 rounds of revisions

I can customize this to match your brand and add any specific features you need (MLS integration, virtual tours, mortgage calculator, etc.).

Experience: 6+ years building real estate websites
Tech stack: WordPress, HTML/CSS, or custom template integration
Timeline: 7-10 days for complete delivery

Ready to start immediately.

Best regards
