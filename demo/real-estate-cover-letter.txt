Hi,

I built a working demo of your real estate website so you can see the exact functionality before we start:  
https://leonidsvb.github.io/upwork-demos/demo/real-estate-website-demo.html

Included features:
✓ Property listings with filters (type, price, acreage, status)  
✓ Advanced search  
✓ Contact/inquiry forms  
✓ Mobile-responsive, fast, SEO-ready structure  

Your $400 package includes:
- Full website setup  
- Custom listing system  
- Search + filter logic  
- Contact forms  
- Mobile optimization  
- Basic SEO  
- Two revision rounds  

If needed, I can also add MLS integration, virtual tours, mortgage calculator, or any custom functionality.

Experience: 6+ years building real estate websites  
Delivery: 7–10 days  
Ready to start.

Best regards,
Leonid
