Hi,

Before applying, I already built a minimal corporate website with Eleventy demonstrating exactly what you need:

👉 **Live Demo:** https://leonidsvb.github.io/upwork-demos/demo/eleventy-site/

Source code: https://github.com/LeonidSvb/upwork-demos/tree/master/demo/eleventy-minimal-corporate

It shows:
✓ Clean Eleventy (11ty) structure
✓ 4 pages with semantic HTML
✓ Minimal vanilla CSS (< 5KB, zero preprocessors)
✓ Zero JavaScript (0KB)
✓ Privacy-first (no tracking, no external scripts)
✓ Sub-second load time
✓ Perfect Lighthouse scores
✓ Cloudflare Pages ready

WHY THIS APPROACH:

Minimal ≠ Simple
- < 10KB total bundle (HTML + CSS)
- Zero client-side JavaScript
- Zero external dependencies
- Zero tracking scripts
- Sub-second load times
- Perfect accessibility

This is exactly what you described: "minimal, high-performance, privacy-focused."

EXPERIENCE:

✓ Eleventy expertise - Built multiple 11ty sites, understand the ecosystem
✓ Performance obsessed - Every millisecond counts, every KB matters
✓ Privacy advocate - No tracking by default, GDPR compliant from day one
✓ Clean code - Semantic HTML5, vanilla CSS, zero bloat
✓ Figma to code - Pixel-perfect implementation with attention to detail

PROCESS:

1. Review Figma designs - Analyze layouts, spacing, typography, components
2. Set up Eleventy structure - Clean folder organization, efficient config
3. Build pages - Semantic HTML + minimal CSS, no frameworks
4. Optimize - Lighthouse testing, accessibility audit, cross-browser check
5. Deploy to Cloudflare Pages - Connect Git, configure build settings
6. Handoff - Documentation, training, source code

TIMELINE:

Depends on site complexity:
- 5-10 pages: 1-2 weeks
- 10-20 pages: 2-3 weeks
- 20+ pages: 3-4 weeks

RATE:

$25-40/hr fits my range. Prefer hourly for ongoing work, can discuss fixed-price for defined scope.

The demo took ~4 hours to build (including documentation). Your actual site with Figma designs will be faster since architecture is proven.

Ready to start when you are.

Best regards,
Leonid
