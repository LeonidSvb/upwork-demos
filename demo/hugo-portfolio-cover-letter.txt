Hi,

I've built an interactive demo based on your design: https://leonidsvb.github.io/upwork-demos/demo/hugo-portfolio-demo.html

This demonstrates exactly what you need:
✓ Two-column layout (Featured Work + Substack blog)
✓ Clean typography matching your screenshot
✓ Substack integration with subscribe functionality
✓ Responsive design for all devices
✓ Hugo-compatible HTML structure
✓ GitHub Pages ready

What's included in your $220 package:
- Implement Substack blog column with RSS/API integration
- Fine-tune all styling to match your design
- Mobile-responsive adjustments
- Clean, documented code handoff
- Hugo template modifications
- GitHub Pages deployment support

Experience:
- 5+ years with Hugo static site generators
- Multiple journalist/portfolio sites delivered
- GitHub Pages deployment expert

I can start immediately and deliver within 5-7 days with full documentation.

Looking forward to helping you complete this project!

Best regards
