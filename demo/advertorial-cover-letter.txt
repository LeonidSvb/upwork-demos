Hi,

I've built an advertorial landing page demo for you: https://leonidsvb.github.io/upwork-demos/demo/advertorial-landing-demo.html

This replicates the exact structure from your ADV #1 example:
- News site format with sticky CTA banner
- Product comparison (#5 to #1 ranking with clear winner)
- Multiple conversion points throughout
- Mobile-responsive, fast-loading HTML/CSS
- Comment section with social proof

My workflow:
- Pure HTML/CSS or WordPress (Elementor/Gutenberg - whatever you prefer)
- 24-48 hour turnaround per page
- Rate: $100-150 per page depending on complexity

Portfolio: 5+ similar advertorial pages delivered for e-commerce clients
Experience: 6+ years building high-conversion landing pages

I can start immediately and deliver 2 pages/week consistently.

Best regards
