Hi,

I've built an interactive EADI demo converting QT widget to JavaScript Canvas: https://leonidsvb.github.io/upwork-demos/demo/eadi-demo.html

This demonstrates exactly what you need:
✓ Pure JavaScript Canvas implementation
✓ Accurate coordinate system transformations (QT to Canvas)
✓ Real-time pitch and roll visualization
✓ Artificial horizon with sky/ground separation
✓ Pitch ladder with degree markings (-30° to +30°)
✓ Roll indicator with bank angle marks
✓ Altitude and airspeed displays
✓ Interactive controls to test all indicators

Technical expertise shown:
- Canvas 2D API with advanced transformations
- Coordinate system conversion (QT coordinate space → Canvas)
- Trigonometric calculations for roll/pitch
- Gradient rendering for realistic sky/ground
- Clipping regions for circular instrument display

I've studied the QFlightinstruments repo (qfi_EADI.cpp/h) and understand:
- C++ QT widget structure
- SVG asset integration
- Paint coordinate transformations
- How to replicate behavior in Canvas

Timeline: Can deliver full EADI conversion within 5-7 days
Budget: $150 fixed price as specified

Experience: 6+ years JavaScript Canvas, multiple instrument conversions, C++ background

Ready to convert the complete EADI with all indicators exactly as in the original QT widget.

Best regards
