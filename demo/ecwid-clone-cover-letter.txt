Hi,

I've created a demo showing my exact process for converting Ecwid sites to custom code: https://leonidsvb.github.io/upwork-demos/demo/ecwid-clone-demo.html

I understand you need:
✓ Exact pixel-perfect copy of your Ecwid website
✓ Clean HTML/CSS/JS code you can self-host
✓ Fast turnaround (I can start immediately)

My process:
1. Inspect your Ecwid site with DevTools
2. Extract all CSS rules, layouts, images, fonts
3. Rebuild in clean HTML/CSS matching 100%
4. Add JavaScript for all functionality (cart, forms, etc.)
5. Test side-by-side to ensure identical appearance
6. Deliver complete code + documentation

Timeline: 48-72 hours from receiving your Ecwid URL

What you get:
- Pixel-perfect recreation
- No monthly Ecwid fees anymore
- Faster loading (no platform bloat)
- Full control over everything
- Mobile responsive
- Clean, documented code

Please send me your Ecwid website URL so I can analyze the exact structure and confirm the 48-72 hour timeline.

Ready to start immediately.

Price: $250 fixed (as posted)

Best regards
