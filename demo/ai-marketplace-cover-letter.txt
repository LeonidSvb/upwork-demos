Hi,

Before applying, I already built a working proof-of-concept that solves your core technical challenges:
https://leonidsvb.github.io/upwork-demos/demo/ai-marketplace-demo.html

It demonstrates exactly what you need:
✓ Bulk upload interface (100-500 files)
✓ AI-powered auto-tagging pipeline
✓ Semantic search with natural language queries
✓ Licensing verification system
✓ Creator + Buyer workflows in one view

Because the technical foundation is already proven, the full MVP build will be faster — it's now architecture, scaling, and integration rather than solving unknowns from scratch.

ANSWERS TO YOUR COMPETENCY QUESTIONS:

1. Multi-sided marketplace experience:
While I haven't built an exact Shutterstock clone, I've built full-stack platforms with:
- Multi-user role systems (buyer/seller/admin)
- Payment processing (Stripe integration)
- Content management workflows
- Search and filtering systems
The demo shows I understand the architecture.

2. Semantic search approach:
- Text embeddings using Sentence Transformers or OpenAI embeddings
- Vector database (Pinecone, Weaviate, or pgvector)
- Hybrid search: keyword (PostgreSQL full-text) + semantic (vector similarity)
- Query expansion for better recall
- Relevance scoring combining both approaches

3. Team composition:
Solo full-stack developer with 7+ years experience:
- Frontend: React, Next.js, TypeScript
- Backend: Node.js, Python, REST/GraphQL APIs
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis
- DevOps: Docker, AWS, CI/CD pipelines
- AI/ML: Integration with Vision APIs, embedding models

Can scale with specialists if needed, but MVP scope is manageable solo.

4. Realistic timeline:
Week 1-2: Core architecture + Creator upload flow + AI tagging pipeline
Week 3-4: Semantic search implementation + Buyer interface
Week 5-6: Licensing system + Stripe integration + Basic blockchain logging
Week 7-8: Admin console + Testing + Documentation + Deployment

Total: 8-10 weeks for fully functional MVP

5. Rate structure:
$85/hour for development
OR
$30,000 fixed price for defined MVP scope (8 weeks, ~350 hours)

Budget fits your $80K if we scope smartly and iterate.

TECHNICAL STACK I'D USE:
Frontend: Next.js 14 (App Router), React, TailwindCSS, TypeScript
Backend: Node.js + Express OR Python FastAPI for AI pipeline
Database: PostgreSQL with pgvector extension for embeddings
Search: Hybrid (PostgreSQL FTS + vector similarity)
AI Tagging: Clarifai/Google Vision API initially, can switch to self-hosted
Storage: AWS S3 with CloudFront CDN
Payments: Stripe Connect for marketplace splits
Blockchain: Ethereum testnet OR Polygon for low-cost logging
DevOps: Docker, AWS ECS/EC2, GitHub Actions CI/CD

WHY THIS APPROACH WORKS:
✓ Solves your #1 pain: AI auto-tagging eliminates manual work
✓ Solves your #2 pain: Semantic search finds content buyers actually need
✓ Solves your #3 pain: Bulk upload handles 100-500 files smoothly
✓ Proven tech stack (no experimental dependencies)
✓ Scalable from day one (microservices-ready architecture)
✓ Fast MVP delivery (working demo already validates core concepts)

WHAT MAKES ME DIFFERENT:
I don't just build features — I solve your actual business problems. The demo proves I understood your challenges and built solutions before you even hired me.

Timeline: 8-10 weeks for MVP
Budget: $30K fixed OR $85/hour (est. $30-35K total)

If you're ready to move fast with someone who's already proven they can deliver, let's discuss the NDA and detailed architecture.

Best regards,
Leonid
