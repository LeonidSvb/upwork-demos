Hi,

Before applying, I already built a working prototype demonstrating your exact technical requirements:
https://leonidsvb.github.io/upwork-demos/demo/weather-graphics-demo.html

It shows:
✓ MapLibre GL base map (Mapbox-compatible)
✓ Timeline animation with 7 time steps
✓ Drawing tools (H/L pressure, fronts, markers)
✓ Smooth object interpolation across timeline
✓ Play/pause/scrub controls
✓ Export PNG at 1920×1080
✓ OBS-ready fixed layout

Because I understand your architecture (you already have a prototype), extending it will be faster than building from scratch.

ANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTIONS:

1. MapboxGL/MapLibre experience:
Yes. Built multiple GIS applications with MapboxGL, custom layers, overlays, and interactive features. The demo uses MapLibre (open-source Mapbox fork).

2. Timeline-based animations:
Yes. The demo shows exactly this — objects interpolate smoothly across time steps synced to forecast timeline. This is the core technical challenge, and I've already solved it.

3. Weather APIs / geospatial data:
Yes. Integrated weather APIs (OpenWeather, Weather.gov), worked with GeoJSON extensively, understand raster tiles, vector layers, and time-series data structures.

4. PNG export at 1920×1080:
Yes. Demo includes working export using html2canvas. Can also implement server-side rendering for better quality or frame sequences for video export.

5. Modular structure approach:
- Separate modules for: Map Engine, Layer Manager, Drawing Tools, Animation Engine, Timeline Controller, Export System
- Each tool as independent class with start/end position properties
- Central state manager for timeline synchronization
- Plugin architecture for adding new Xweather layers
- Clean separation: UI ↔ Logic ↔ Map Rendering

TECHNICAL PLAN:

Week 1: Integrate ALL Xweather layers + modular layer config
Week 2: Complete drawing tools suite + edit/delete logic
Week 3: Animation engine + timeline sync with Xweather timestamps
Week 4: Export suite (PNG + sequence) + OBS compatibility polish

Timeline: 4 weeks
Budget: $3,000 fixed (as posted)

WHY I'M THE RIGHT FIT:
✓ I already understand your project (demo proves it)
✓ Can work with your existing prototype code
✓ Timeline animation is exactly what I specialize in
✓ Fast delivery with modular, clean architecture
✓ No learning curve — ready to extend your code immediately

The demo shows I can deliver. The prototype already validates the approach.

Ready to start immediately.

Best regards,
Leonid
