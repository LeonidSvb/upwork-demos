Hi,

I've built a precision demo following your strict specifications: https://leonidsvb.github.io/upwork-demos/demo/institutional-static-site/index.html

This demonstrates exactly what you need:
✓ Semantic HTML5 structure
✓ Vanilla CSS (no frameworks)
✓ Minimal JavaScript
✓ WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
✓ JSON-LD schema markup (Organization + Breadcrumb)
✓ Monochrome, text-focused design
✓ Keyboard navigation with focus indicators
✓ No external dependencies

Answers to your screening questions:

1. Yes, I can execute exactly as specified with zero deviation or added elements.

2. Demo example: The site above uses only HTML5, CSS, and minimal vanilla JS - no frameworks.

3. WCAG 2.1 AA implementation:
   - Keyboard nav: Full Tab support, visible focus indicators, skip-to-content link
   - Headings: Proper h1-h4 hierarchy without skipping levels
   - Contrast: Black on white (21:1 ratio, exceeds 4.5:1 minimum)
   - ARIA: Landmarks (banner, navigation, main, contentinfo), aria-current, aria-labels

4. JSON-LD validation: Google Rich Results Test + Schema.org Validator before deployment.

Timeline: 5-7 days as specified

I thrive in specification-driven environments where precision matters more than creativity.

Best regards
